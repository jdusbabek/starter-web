# Starter Web Project

This is a simple web site project for showing how to use Git and Github together.
We like doing things simple around here.

Notepad++ really hates .md files. 

## Introduction

I'm using this project as I learn to use Git.  There are lots of things I could say here, but won't.  I'll finish up this.

## Purpose

The purpose is to learn git.

I already know a lot, but want to learn more.

There is really no more purpose to this file.  Doing rebasing example.

## How to Contribute

I don't really want anyone else contributing to this project, so don't bother.  There are lots of other worthwhile projects out there.

Add your name to humans.txt.

Please fork and issue pull request. 

## Deployment

Deploy this to a web server.  I will be adding Docker build information forthcoming.

## Docker

cp ./* /var/www
docker run -v /var/www:/var/www/html -d -p80:80 nginx/latest

*/ I had to add this close comment here for my sanity.
