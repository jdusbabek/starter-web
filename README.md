# Starter Web Project

This is a simple web site project for showing how to use Git and Github together.
We like doing things simple around here.

## Introduction

I'm using this project as I learn to use Git.  There are lots of things I could say here, but won't.  I'll finish up this.

## Purpose

The purpose is to learn git.

I already know a lot, but want to learn more.

## How to Contribute

I don't really want anyone else contributing to this project, so don't bother.  There are lots of other worthwhile projects out there.

## Deployment

Deploy this to a web server.
